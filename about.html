      I'm an aspiring front-end developer with a passion for turning ideas into interactive web experiences. I enjoy learning new technologies, building responsive layouts, and sharing what I discover along the way. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring creative projects, improving my digital skills, or just enjoying a good game.

        <h2>Hobbies and Pleasures</h2>
        <p class="details">
          When I'm not coding or working, I love diving into video games, especially old-school action games that bring back that nostalgic thrill. I enjoy watching football — a big Chelsea fan through and through — and I always look forward to match days. I also find joy in reading, creative exploration, and spending quiet moments reflecting or engaging in spiritual activities. These simple pleasures keep me balanced and inspired.
